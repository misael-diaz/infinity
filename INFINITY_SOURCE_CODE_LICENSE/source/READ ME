Youare bound by a non-disclosure agreement that was previously executed.The enclosed files comprise the complete source code to the current (1.1d13)revision of Marathon Infinity, a work in progress.To build the project as we do, you'll have to use a recent version of MPWand MrC 2.0.2d1c7 or later. You shouldn't have too many problems buildingthe project with CodeWarrior for daily work.The project is broken into two major components: the CSeries library and thegame itself. The CSeries library is a collection of utilities that haveevolved through the various Bungie projects. The replacement "buildprogram"MPW scripts and the makefiles rely on the definition of a few variables thatpoint at the includes and objects for the CSeries library. You'll want toset aside a target folder for these and setup the MPW variables{CSeriesInterfaces} and {CSeriesLibraries}.The build steps are typically:cd :InfinityForSprockets:cseries.lib:buildprogram cseries.debugcd ::marathon2:buildprogram marathon2.beta.ppcPlease contact me with any questions you have.--Alex RosenbergBungie Software Products Corporation(312) 563-6200 x.44alexr@bungie.com
