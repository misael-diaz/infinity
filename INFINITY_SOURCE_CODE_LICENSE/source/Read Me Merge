Here are the files that have changed since the last release of code I sent.
This corresponds to 1.1b16+ some changes that haven't been released.

I'm still looking for a solution to the garbling of the network microphone.
The code now functions exactly as well as Marathon 1 did. That is to say,
it doesn't work on Power Macs. I tried to get Jim Reekes to look at this,
and Bob Aron was trying to "reproduce" the problem, but I think that they
need a poke in the side to get them to look at it. Any volunteers?

I'm working on adding a preference for resolution switching because some
lamers with AV cards and old monitors just can't get synced.

We're still working on occasional preference file "corruption" problems.
These manifest themselves as a bad Sounds file reference leading us to
start using random junk as sound parameters.

Here's the list of enclosed files:
