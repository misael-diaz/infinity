Here are the files that have changed since the last release of code I sent.This corresponds to 1.1b16+ some changes that haven't been released.I'm still looking for a solution to the garbling of the network microphone.The code now functions exactly as well as Marathon 1 did. That is to say,it doesn't work on Power Macs. I tried to get Jim Reekes to look at this,and Bob Aron was trying to "reproduce" the problem, but I think that theyneed a poke in the side to get them to look at it. Any volunteers?I'm working on adding a preference for resolution switching because somelamers with AV cards and old monitors just can't get synced.We're still working on occasional preference file "corruption" problems.These manifest themselves as a bad Sounds file reference leading us tostart using random junk as sound parameters.Here's the list of enclosed files:project infinityºcseries.libºcheckout    devices.ccheckout    macintosh_cseries.hcheckout    macintosh_interfaces.ccheckout    macintosh_utilities.ccheckout    makefileproject infinityºmarathon2ºcheckout    export_definitions.makecheckout    game_sound.ccheckout    game_sound.hcheckout    game_wad.ccheckout    interface.ccheckout    interface.hcheckout    items.ccheckout    low_level_textures.ccheckout    makefilecheckout    map.hcheckout    marathon2.ccheckout    marathon2.rcheckout    monster_definitions.hcheckout    monsters.ccheckout    network.hcheckout    network_dialogs.ccheckout    network_games.ccheckout    network_speaker.ccheckout    player.ccheckout    preferences.ccheckout    projectiles.hcheckout    screen.ccheckout	scottish_textures.scheckout    shell.ccheckout    shell.hcheckout    sound_macintosh.ccheckout    vbl.ccheckout    vbl.hproject infinityºmarathon2ºbinariesºcheckout    demo.resourcecheckout    marathon2.resource--AlexR 8/19/96
