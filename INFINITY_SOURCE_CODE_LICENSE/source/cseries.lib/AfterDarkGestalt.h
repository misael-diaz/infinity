/* AfterDarkGestalt.h All Gestalt selectors that are defined by After Dark.   Copyright c 1990-93 Berkeley Systems, Inc. 5/20/93*/#ifndef __AFTER_DARK_GESTALT__#define __AFTER_DARK_GESTALT__/*-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- The routines identified here work with After Dark 2.0u (released xxx) and later including Star Trek The Screen Saver.  If someone has After Dark they probably have a version that supports the Gestalt calls.  If someone has an earlier version of After Dark 2.0  they can upgrade to the latest version for free by contacting Berkeley Systems.  Some stuff was added for Star Trek The Screen Saver (released 11/92) and After Dark 2.0x  (released 1/93).  These have been identified by the define 'AD20x'.  They will not work with versions of AD earlier than version 2.0x.---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- *//* generic screen saver selectors. */#define gestaltScreenSaverAttr 'SAVR'  /* defined if a screen saver is installed. *//* Gestalt called with 'SAVR' selector returns longword bitmask.
